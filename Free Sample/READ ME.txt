If you plan to either use MonMae (MonTamer Maker) or buy the full version, you should use
the non-compressed version of the tileset, so that you don't have to re-create
any scenes after upgrading. If you use the compressed version, and then upgrade and start
using the full version, the tiles will not match up and you'll have to recreate your scenes.
